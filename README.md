## My process

### Built with

- HTML Semantics
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second attempt with making a responsive landing page and I've learned about handling SVG for curved sections. This is also my first time using font awesome icons. 

### Continued development

I initially tried copying the SVG tag directly on the HTML file however it shows a whitespace underneath for the top sections. I tried checking if it was a border or a margin but it did not worked. I then used the img tag instead to refer to the SVG files and the whitespace was removed.
